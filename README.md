## Description

The payroll tracker displays the personnel in order of the last name. The console displays the average income/salary and a winner of the draw that the company performs per payroll

- Use JavaScript and the prompt to get inputs and display on the browser.
- The excersise was conducted to improve and hone the first JavaScript skills.
- The problem that was solved is the orderly display of the personnel and salary, plus averaging the salaries and displaying a winner out of a random draw.
- I learned how to use window prompts/alarms etc. I learned how to use arrays and object arrays.

## Usage

Click "Add Employees" and follow the prompt, when you are done hit cancel and the names will be displayed with the salary and in the console the average and winner will be displayed.
